    <h2>What is NJ Boardgames?</h2>
    <p>NJ Boardgames is a community-driven hub for tabletop gamers across New Jersey.
    We list a variety of in-person tabletop gaming event. We emphasise and encourage "free and open boardgaming" so we feature those events. We also list niche tabletop gaming events like RPGs, CCGs, Scrabble, etc. but they will not be featured. We are not affiliated with the individual groups, venues, or their platforms; we simply help surface local options for you.</p>

<section id="how-to-find-events">
    <h2>How do I find events in my area?</h2>
    <p>From the <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}#gaming">homepage</a>, choose your county. Each county page shows a list of upcoming events pulled from our calendars and a list of featured recurring meetups. Always check the organizer’s site or social media for the latest details, RSVP rules, and any cancellations.</p>

<section id="what-events-allowed">
    <h2>What kinds of events are allowed on the site?</h2>
    <p>We only list in-person tabletop gaming (board games, niche games like chess or RPGs, design and playtesting, etc.), as well as conventions with open gaming. Clubs that charge membership are okay if they offer a way for new people to try it out. We do not list online-only events, private events, sales, auctions, or anything that requires non-gaming participation (e.g. religious or promotional content).</p>
