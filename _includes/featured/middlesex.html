			A Modern Tabletop Gaming Event. We will have beginner games like Catan, Sushi Go!, Splendor, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, & Codenames, as well as some slightly more advanced games like Wingspan and Everdell. For people familiar with the hobby, feel free to bring your own games if you'd like. If you don't know how to play a game, we'll teach you! For an idea of what modern tabletop games are, you can check out this short documentary <a href="https://youtu.be/DYedXMq-R6I" aria-label="Events">The Board Game Boom</a> on YouTube. You should not expect to see anything mainstream like Monopoly, Scrabble, Boggle, Risk, Battleship, Yahtzee, or Poker. This is also not a Dungeons and Dragons, Magic, Warhammer, or other niche event. Anyone age 14 and up who is interested in playing great games with great people! Age 8 and up if accompanied by a participating adult and able to learn & play age 8+ games.
